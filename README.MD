DollarTrak App
--------------

* The intent of this app is to give the user a tool to help manage their personal finances. It will allow user to configure monthly budget, as well as a light menu version for logging money spent while on the go throughout the day.  

* The target of this app is people who have trouble keeping track of their money, what they spend it on, paying off debt, saving money for emergencies, goals, and retirement.

* The app will give the user a simple light menu for entering all transactions of spending money during their daily activities, then allow user to see how these transactions affect their planned monthly budget.

* Success of app is attained when the user is able to track every dollar of their budget on a monthly basis, and hopefully demonstrates how the user can be debt free and build wealth.

* Potential issues - personal financial data must be protected.

* There are many budget apps but many do not allow user to log transactions during daily activities in an easy process.
